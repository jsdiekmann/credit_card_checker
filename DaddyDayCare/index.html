            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p>Jared Diekmann Appreciates You is a podcast to share appreciation for what makes all of us who we are as individuals. It's my belief that a genuine curiosity about each other's interests brings us closer together and fosters a sense of appreciation for each other. When we feel we are appreciated for who we are and not what we are, we are more free to become what we want to be and to make the change in the world that we want to make. I love the idea of sitting down and getting to know people and their stories.</p>
            <h3>Your Host</h3>
            <img id="headshot" src="headshot.jpg">  
            <p>Born in Germany and raised all over the world, Jared Diekmann brings a unique perspective as our host. As a football player, Jared was what many people would refer to as a "future coach" (see: unathletic). This assessment proved prophetic as he spent 10 years coaching football. His experience spanned Freshman Football all the way up to Division 1 (FCS). </p>
